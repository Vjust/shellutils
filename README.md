Useful shell utilities


To use (if using zsh) :

1. alias getsubzshrc="curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Vjust/shellutils/master/.subzshrc > .subzshrc" 
2. getsubzshrc (from ~ - home directory)
3. add a line in your .zshrc "source .subzshrc"
4. source .zshrc

For future updates these two steps will do:

1. getsubzshrc
2. source .zshrc
